## Project Collection Information: 

In here you will find all informaton about my projects seen on the homepage. Thank you so much for coming to check out my work! 

### 1. The Legend of the Mage: 

The Legend of the Mage takes place in the Middle Ages in the small town of Fernsworth. You the adventurer seek to find the long-lost staff of the Legendary Mage to help Fernsworth defend against the impending doom from the evil dragon Emrum. This story begins when a group of people come rushing into the Fernsworth Tavern in fear after hearing a loud roar beyond the Mountain Pass of Beverdosa and ask you if you will go and find the Legendary Mageâ€™s staff to save Fernsworth from destruction. 

This project was fun to work on, there were some struggles, but I managed to get through them with a help of a fellow progammer of mine. My favorite parts that I worked on in this game were finding the ASCII Art and music to enhance the overall gameplay. I wanted to make you feel immersed in the environment of my game and the ACSII art and music make that so.

### 2. Store Application:

The Store Application is an application that allows you as the "Customer" to choose one of the four options of items to purchase from Costoc Wholesale. When you first run the application, you are greeted with a Welcome message and then are asked what your name is. After inputing your name you are then greeted with a hello and you are then asked to choose one of the four food options that you would like to purchase.

### 3. Guessing Game:

The Guessing Game Application is an application where you as the "Player" have to try and guess what word that the "NPC" is thinking of. The main three words that I had selected for this were: cat, hat, and rat. Each time the game resets, one of those three words are chosen at random so the player cannot just guess the words until the find the right one at the start.

### 4. Madlib Generator:

The Madlib Generator Application is an application where you as the "player" insert a specific, noun, adjective, or occupation when asked by the application. After you have input your desired words for each specified type, the program will put your desired words to fill in the blanks of a written story. This application has so much unlimited potential to come up funny short stories. Take a look below to see what came out of my word selections:

### 5. Substitution Cipher:

The Substitution Cipher application is an application where the "player" is asked whether they would like to encode or decode a message. When the player chooses option one to encode, you will enter your message and then the cipher will encode your message. Below your message you wanted to encode will be the encoded message, which is when you want the decode option to come into play. If you want to decode your message you will need to select option two. After selecting option two, you will be asked to input your encoded message so the application can decode it, and once you are done typing in your encoded secret message hit enter and it will decode it revealing your secret message.
