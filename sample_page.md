## Project Collection Information: 

In here you will find all informaton about my projects seen on the homepage. Thank you so much for coming to check out my work! 

### 1. The Legend of the Mage 

The Legend of the Mage takes place in the Middle Ages in the small town of Fernsworth. You the adventurer seek to find the long-lost staff of the Legendary Mage to help Fernsworth defend against the impending doom from the evil dragon Emrum. This story begins when a group of people come rushing into the Fernsworth Tavern in fear after hearing a loud roar beyond the Mountain Pass of Beverdosa and ask you if you will go and find the Legendary Mageâ€™s staff to save Fernsworth from destruction. 

This project was fun to work on, there were some struggles, but I managed to get through them with a help of a fellow progammer of mine. My favorite parts that I worked on in this game were finding the ASCII Art and music to enhance the overall gameplay. I wanted to make you feel immersed in the environment of my game and the ACSII art and music make that so.
